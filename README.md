# Variant Table, a Figma plugin
**Version: alpha v0.2**

===

## Introduction
This plugin is designed to boost designer's handoff process, it can generated all kind of scenario of your component. Instead of engineer and other designer have to jumping back and forth of your design file and design sysytem file, it's easier to see all the usage of the component directly in your design file.

I made this because I want to make my life and my teammate's life easier, I hope this plugin can make your's life easier too!
